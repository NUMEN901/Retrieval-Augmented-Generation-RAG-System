# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-System-
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot that allows users to upload multiple PDFs, extract key information, and ask questions about the content. The system uses FAISS for efficient similarity-based text retrieval and OpenAI's GPT for generating answers based on retrieved context.
